### Hello!

I'am an Android and web developer full  MÃ©xico. 

Self-taught, with 3 years of experience in learning and developing both frontend and backend for mobile and web applications, I have found a new passion in programming. 

I'll thank you for any feedback that you can give me :)

Tecnologies i kown:  
SpringBoot, Angular, AndroidStudio, Java, TypeScript, MySQL, SQLite, Git/Github, HTML, XML.

**[Take a look at my web portfolio](https://pacomorando.github.io/portfolio)**

And if you find something useful, here you can get the Android applications that I have developed:
- **[Listagram](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sas.listagram)** (An ad-free app for making expense lists, checklists, and notes).
- **[Graphic Ruler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sas.graphicruler)** (An ad-free app that emulates a real-value scale ruler).
